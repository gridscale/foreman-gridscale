# ForemanGridscale

*Plugin to enable management of gridscale instances from within foreman*

## Requirements
Foreman gridscale has the following requirements:

* Foreman 1.15+
* A working internet connection

## Installation

1. Extract the supplied archive on the server which has Foreman installed on it. Make sure to do this in a directory which can be accessed by the user running Foreman.

2. In the foreman/bundler.d directory (usually found in /usr/share/), create or edit the file Gemfile.local.rb and add the following lines to it:

    ```ruby
    gem 'fog-gridscale', :path => 'path to fog-gridscale directory'
    gem 'foreman_gridscale', :path => 'path to foreman-gridscale directory'
    ```

3. Next run the following command: 

    ```
    $ cd /usr/share/foreman && sudo -u foreman /usr/bin/foreman-ruby /usr/bin/bundle install
    ```

4. Then restart Foreman with:
    ```
    $ touch /usr/share/foreman/tmp/restart.txt
    ```

## How to Use
### Configuration

Go to **Infrastructure > Compute Resources** and click on "New Compute Resource".

Choose **gridscale** as the provider, and fill in all the fields. You need your API token and user uuid with read and write access, which can be created in the [gridscale API section](https://my.gridscale.io/APIs/). 

That's it. You're now ready to create and manage servers in your new gridscale compute resource.

You should see something like this on the [Compute Resource](https://theforeman.org/manuals/1.19/index.html#5.2ComputeResources) page:

### Host Creation
1. Go to host > create host and choose gridscale as a deployment target. The virtual machine tab with all of the parameter fields to create a server will appear
2. If you already set up your compute profile, you can choose it and it will automatically set up the virtual machine parameters. you can also overwrite them
3. On the virtual machine tab, fill in the fields with the desired number cores, memory, and capacity of the storage. You can also attach a gridscale or private template to your storage
4. Fill the operating system tab
5. In the interface tab, click the edit button in actions column, and pick the gridscale network interface you wish to connect your machine to. You can also add multiple network interfaces by clicking the add interface button below the interface table. click OK once you have finished
6. Click submit button to finish the Host creation

### Compute Profile
1. Click infrastructure > compute profile
2. Click create compute profile button on the top right side of the screen
3. Fill in the name field, and click the submit button
4. Click on the compute resource link that you want to associate with your compute profile
5. Fill out the compute profile attributes and click the submit button
6. You are now ready to use your compute profile

### Host Management
Click Host > All Host. You will be able to see all of the hosts that were created through foreman in the tables. The Power column shows the power status of the server. The hostâ€™s details can be seen by clicking the link in its name.
    
**Powering off/on**
1. Choose the host by checking the box in the first column of the table (you can select all of the hosts by checking the box in the header)
2. Click the action button, and choose change power state
3. Select the desired power state from the dropdown power list
4. Click submit

**Delete Host**
1. Choose the host by checking the box in the first column of the table (you can select all of the hosts by checking the box on the header)
2. Click the action button, and choose delete host (you can also delete them individually by clicking the dropdown list in the actions column)
3. Click submit and confirm the action


###Host management through the compute resource page
Go to Infrastructure > Compute resource and select the compute resource for gridscale. go to the virtual machine tab. The virtual machine tab displays all of the servers in the gridscale panel.

##Known Issues
* When creating a host, multiple network interfaces can be set to bootable. The gridscale platform does not support this, which is why only one of the interfaces will actually be set to bootable if this is the case
* When creating a compute profile, the chosen network interface configuration is not saved
* The Virtual Machines overview of a compute resource can take a long time to load
* Opening the console of a host in Foreman has not been implemented, but a link to gridscale is supplied
* Acpi power off fails to shut down a system which did not boot
